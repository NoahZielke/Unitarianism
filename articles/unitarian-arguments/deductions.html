                    This article is composed of a series of if-then statements, each aimed to be a simple Biblical argument against Jesus being God. They are intentionally short, and concise, and therefore serve as a good starting point for those studying the topic of what the Bible teaches about God and Jesus, and hopefully serve as inspiration for deeper reflection and study.

                    <li>If Jesus denied coming to do His own will, and instead said that He came to do the will of the Father (John 5:30, 5:43, 6:38, 8:42)<!-- John 4:34 -->, then Jesus is not God.</li>
                    <li>If Jesus denied speaking from Himself, and instead said that He spoke what God told Him to speak (John 7:16-18, 8:28, 12:49-50, 14:10), then Jesus is not God. <!-- John 7:16, 8:28, 12:49-50, 14:10 (John 3:34, 17:8) --></li>
                    <li>If Jesus glorifying Himself is invalid, but the Father glorifying Him is valid (John 8:54), then Jesus is not God.</li>

                    <li>If Jesus did not know the day or the hour of His return, but God did know the day and the hour (Matthew 24:36, Mark 13:32), then Jesus is not God.</li>

                    <li>If the Apostles said of Jesus that "God was with him" (Acts 10:38-42), then Jesus is not God.</li>

                    <!-- <li>If Jesus demonstrated "obedience" to God (Philippians 2:8-9, Hebrews 5:8), then Jesus is not God.</li> -->
                    <li>If Jesus is a the mediator between God and sinful mankind (Romans 8:34: 1 Timothy 2:5, Hebrews 7:25: 1 John 2:1), then Jesus is not God.</li>
                    <li>If the Father is "above all" (Ephesians 4:6<!-- John 10:29 -->), then Jesus is not God.</li>
