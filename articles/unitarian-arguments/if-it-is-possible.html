                    In the Gospels, on the night before His crucifixion, Jesus is recorded praying to God, and asking Him to somehow provide a way to escape the impending crucifixion, if it is possible (Matthew 26:39, Mark 14:36, Luke 22:42):
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Matthew 26:39 (LEB)</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        39 And going forward a little he fell down on his face, praying and saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    Consider the above words of the Lord carefully, and whether one who is Almighty God could make such a prayer:
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Firstly, consider whether God could preface any prayer to God with the words, "if it is possible". God knows everything, including what is possible, and what is impossible. Having all knowledge, God knows what any given agent in existence is disposed to do, or not to do, at any given moment. Unless Jesus and the Father share different, disconnected minds - in which case, they would be distinct Beings - then Jesus would already know whether it is possible or not. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Secondly, if Jesus were God, would this plea be genuine? It sounds as though Jesus is asking for something which He wants, and which He is not sure that God wants, and is not sure that He will get. The fact that He is uncertain as to whether the prayer will be answered demonstrates that He does not have the mind of God, and does not have all knowledge. The only other interpretive option is to suggest that Jesus, knowing that this prayer would be denied, merely spoke as though He was unsure, and that it may in fact be granted, as a lesson to those who would listen. But, what would be the purpose of such a lesson? If it were to demonstrate that He would submit to the Father's will, there would be no need to ask for a way to escape the fate of the cross, or express uncertainty as to whether it would be provided. Instead, He would merely need to say what He said at the end of the verse - something like, "I do not wish to go to the cross, yet not as I will, but as you will". His asking to escape cannot simply be ignored. He asked to escape because He wanted that prayer to be granted.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Thirdly, the fact that Jesus desired this petition to be granted, and yet it was not granted, demonstrates that His will and God's will are distinct. Jesus wanted something, God wanted something else, and Jesus submitted His will, in faith, to God's. If God is a single, perfect, Being, can He have different, opposing wills?
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    In response, those who believe in the Deity of Christ may say, "He spoke from His human nature". The verse, however, gives no hint that He is not speaking as a single Person - Jesus Christ. There is only one Person speaking in the verse in question - a single subject, entreating another subject. Neither the Gospel writers, nor Jesus Himself, ever concern themselves with explaining how in one passage, Jesus spoke from His divine nature, saying something that was not true of His human nature, and in another passage, spoke from His human nature, saying something that was not true of His divine nature. These things are only read into various passages because those passages, if they are not qualified in such a way, create interpretive problems for the doctrine of the Deity of Christ. Yet, the Gospel authors never make such qualifications. There is no contextual reason to believe that Jesus is praying in His human nature for something to happen, which He knows in His divine nature cannot happen, and will never be granted. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    When this passage is taken simply, and straightforwardly, it demonstrates that Jesus is not God, but rather one who submitted His will to God, and then was glorified by God on account of that, being the ultimate example of faith for believers to follow.
