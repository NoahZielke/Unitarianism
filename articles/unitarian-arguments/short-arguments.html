                    What follows are some short, concise arguments for Unitarianism. These are developed more in other resources, both on this site, and written by others, but this is intended as a brief overview of some points favoring a Unitarian view of God and Scripture.
                </p>
                <h3 class="pb-1">5 Arguments</h3>
                <ol class="gen">
                    <li>If the Father is logically prior to the Son and Spirit, then the Son and Spirit are created, even if they are "begotten" or "spirated" "outside of time" or eternally, or necessarily. That is, if the Father is the original "source" of life for the Son and Spirit, and communicated His life to them, then they are created entities, as they have an entity logically prior to them, who caused them.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If, on the other hand, the Father, Son, and Spirit are three distinct agents, all with no logically prior causes, then there are three Gods.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The behavior of those closest to Jesus when He was arrested, and put to death, gives no indication that they thought He was God. If one sees that the one who they believe is God has just been arrested, and later died, it would be readily apparent - something like that does not go unmentioned. Also, after the resurrection, they do not puzzle over God having died, or comment on it in any way. </li>
                    <li>The first preaching of the Apostles after the resurrection, when their religion was the newest, and most in need of clarification, and the most subject to misunderstanding, totally excludes the doctrine that Jesus is God, and instead communicates that He is distinct from God, and is not God (Acts 2:22, 2:36, 3:13, 3:26, 4:10, 10:38, 13:37-38, 17:30-31).</li>
                    <li>If a subject is said to sit at the right hand of Yahweh (Psalm 110:1, Matthew 22:41-45), then they are not Yahweh. A subject at the right hand of Yahweh is distinct from Yahweh.</li>
                    <li>If a subject is said to be the Son of God (Mark 1:1), then they are not God. The "son of" a person is not that person.</li>
                </ol>
