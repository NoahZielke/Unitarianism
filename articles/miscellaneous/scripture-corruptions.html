                    The following chart compiles instances in which the translation or text of the Bible has arguably been altered in favor of the doctrine of the Trinity, or Deity of Christ. Because of the controversial nature of textual criticism and translation, some of these should be reckoned as <i>potential</i> corruptions, with others being more certain.

                            <tr><td>Acts 20:28</td><td>Commonly translated so as to call Jesus "God", when it is more likely that "God" refers to the Father, and the latter part of the verse says "the blood of His own (one, Son)"</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>Romans 9:5</td><td>Commonly translated so as to call Jesus "God", when it most likely speaks of Jesus being blessed by God, or is a benediction referring to God. Jesus is distinguished from God without comment throughout the entire epistle (Romans 1:1-3, 1:7-9, 2:16, 3:24-26, 5:1, 5:8-11, 5:15, 6:11, 6:23, 7:4, 7:25, 8:3, 8:31-32, 8:39, 10:9, 14:18, 15:5-6, 16:27), so the Apostle Paul conflating them one time in chapter 9 without additional comment or emphasis would make little sense</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>1 Timothy 3:16</td><td>Early Greek evidence demonstrates that certain scribes changed ὃς (he who) to θεὸς (God), apparently attempting to directly have Jesus called "God". However, it would be compatible with Unitarianism in either case, as God was definitely manifested in Jesus (John 1:18, 12:45, 14:9-11: 2 Corinthians 4:4, Colossians 1:13-15, Hebrews 1:1-3)</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>Titus 2:13</td><td>Commonly translated to apply "God" to Jesus by advocates of the Granville Sharp Rule, when it actually refers to the Father, as in Titus 1:4</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>2 Peter 1:1</td><td>As Titus 2:13, this is commonly translated to apply "God" to Jesus by advocates of the Granville Sharp Rule, when "God" actually refers to the Father, just as in the other epistolary introductions. Jesus is clearly distinguished from God in the very next verse (2 Peter 1:2)</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>1 John 5:7</td><td>Nearly an entire sentence is added in some early Latin manuscripts, missing from all early Greek manuscripts, stating that the Father, Word, and Holy Spirit are "one", which has been construed as a Trinitarian statement (which is arguable - there are definitely ways of understanding this in a Unitarian way - it would say about as much as John 10:30, which is not Trinitarian, either)</td></tr>
                        </tr>
