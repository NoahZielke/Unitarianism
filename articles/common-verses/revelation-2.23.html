                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    In this passage, Jesus says what Yahweh says in Jeremiah 17:10. This demonstrates that He is Yahweh.
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Here, Jesus says the same thing that God says in Jeremiah 17:10. Concluding that on that basis, He just is God, is a massive logical leap, which would need much more supporting evidence to substantiate.

                    Consider how, to this point in the book, the author has always and everywhere distinguished God from Jesus, in a way that guards against such an interpretation:

                    Additionally, in both Revelation 1:6 above, and repeatedly in a verse from the chapter after the passage in question, Jesus is taught to Himself have a God (also compare Revelation 3:2):

                    Unless one would assert that this author is, without any commentary or explanation, declaring that God Himself has a God, these statements are more testimonies to the fact that God is distinct from Jesus. When the entire work is considered, there is no ambiguity on that point.

                <p class="gen">
                    In the passage in question, Jesus is taking on His role as God's appointed agent of judgment - a role which He confesses has been given to Him by God (John 5:22, 5:27). He is not, by quoting Jeremiah 17:10, declaring that He just is Yahweh.
