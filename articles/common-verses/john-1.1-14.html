                            1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <br>
                            2 The same was in the beginning with God. <br>
                            3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. <br>
                            4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men. <br>
                            5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. <br>
                            6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. <br>
                            7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. <br>
                            8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. <br>
                            9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. <br>
                            10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. <br>
                            11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not. <br>
                            12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: <br>
                            13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. <br>
                            14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

                <p class="gen">
                    Argument: The "word was God" (verse 1), created all things (verses 3, 10), and became flesh (verse 14), which, in context, refers to Jesus.
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Jesus could be called "God" here, though many interpret the "word" to refer to an aspect of God's nature in a similar way to how the book of Proverbs refers to wisdom (Proverbs 3:19, 8:1-36), and that Jesus is a perfect embodiment of God's attributes in that He expresses God's qualities and character (John 1:18, 12:45, 14:9-11: 2 Corinthians 4:4, Colossians 1:13-15, Hebrews 1:1-3).
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Some Unitarians believe that God created all things by Jesus Christ, who was the first of His creation, but some also interpret the creation to be personal to God, and an expression of His word/wisdom, but not necessarily personal to Jesus Christ who would embody it.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    With respect to Jesus possibly being called "God", if that is the case, then Jesus would be called "God" in the lesser sense of the word, as it is used in Exodus 7:1, 21:6, 22:8-9, Psalm 82:1, 82:6, 97:7: 2 Corinthians 4:4, as explained by Jesus in John 10:33-36.
