                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Jesus is called "God over all".
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    This verse has a contested translation. The NRSVUE lists three potential translations for the relevant part of the verse:
                </p>
                <ul class="gen">
                    <li>Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever</li>
                    <li>Messiah, who is God over all, blessed forever</li>
                    <li>Messiah. May he who is God over all be blessed forever</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="gen">
                    Considering how often the book of Romans explicitly distinguishes Jesus from God (Romans 1:1-3, 1:7-9, 2:16, 3:24-26, 5:1, 5:8-11, 5:15, 6:11, 6:23, 7:4, 7:25, 8:3, 8:31-32, 8:39, 10:9, 14:18, 15:5-6, 16:27), a rendering which makes Jesus called "God over all" in this single verse in chapter 9, which is introduced incidentally, and receives no explanation, is unlikely. If Jesus is explicitly and clearly distinguished from God over and over again in a work, then when a case arises, as in the passage in question, where it is dubious whether one or two subjects are in mind, it makes more sense to go with the pattern seen in the rest of the epistle.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Therefore, a reading like, "God, who is over all, be blessed forever" (REV) makes more sense, and it is likely that this is a benediction, like the one given at the end of Romans 1:25.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    However, if Jesus were in fact called "God" here, there are ways of understanding that from a Unitarian perspective. Here, Jesus would be called "God" in the lesser sense of the word, as it is used in Exodus 7:1, 21:6, 22:8-9, Psalm 82:1, 82:6, 97:7: 2 Corinthians 4:4, as explained by Jesus in John 10:33-36. But, such a reading seems unlikely, in light of the other valid ways to translate the passage.
