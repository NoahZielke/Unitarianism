                            8 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. <br>
                            9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; <br>
                            10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. <br>
                            11 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; <br>
                            12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. <br>
                            13 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. <br>
                            14 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.

                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Jesus is worshipped alongside God in a religious setting. Additionally, Jesus is said to receive "glory", when God says that He will share His glory with no one in Isaiah 42:8, 48:11.
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Unitarians affirm that Jesus can be praised and worshipped for who He is and what He does, which is what is taking place in this passage. In Philippians 2:9-11, worship to the Son is shown to be "to the glory of God the Father", who exalted Him to His position. Jesus does not compete with God for worship, because He both exists and occupies His current position solely because of God, and all Biblical worship of Him is done from that perspective. Notice that in the passage in question, Jesus is never worshipped for being the one God - such a thing does not happen anywhere in Scripture.

                <p class="gen">
                    With respect to Jesus receiving "glory" when God declares that He will not share His glory with another, please see the <a href="isaiah-42.8.html">discussion of Isaiah 42:8, 48:11</a>.
