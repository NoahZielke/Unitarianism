                <p class="gen">
                    Yahweh, in these passages, says that He will not give His glory to another. Yet, passages like Revelation 5:12-13 say, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing". So, if Jesus is not God, then God has given His glory to another, in violation of these passages.
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    The context of the passages in Isaiah is that Yahweh is not going to give His glory to false gods. Jesus is not a false god, and so the worship of Jesus, which is "to the glory of the God the Father" (Philippians 2:11), and is worshipping Him as God's Messiah, not God, is not in violation of these passages.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The concept of "glory" in the Bible is rather expansive, and the Bible talks about God's "glory" being given to others in various ways (Romans 8:30: 2 Timothy 2:10), for instance:

                        22 <b>The glory that you have given me I have given them,</b> so that they may be one, as we are one, <br>
                        23 I in them and you in me, that they may become completely one, so that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. <br>
                        24 Father, I desire that those also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, <b>to see my glory, which you have given me</b> because you loved me before the foundation of the world.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    Additionally, the Bible, both in the passage above, and elsewhere, speaks of Jesus "receiving" glory from God (John 8:54, 13:31-32, 17:5, Acts 3:13: 2 Peter 1:17<!--Hebrews 2:9-->), which makes little sense if He were Himself God. But, these examples are not of individuals receiving glory in opposition to God, or honoring others as God instead of God, which is what is being condemned in the passages in question from Isaiah. They are instead instances of others being honored for other reasons, as deemed appropriate by God.
