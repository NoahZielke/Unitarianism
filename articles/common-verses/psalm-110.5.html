                            1 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. <br>
                            2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. <br>
                            3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. <br>
                            4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. <br>
                            5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. <br>
                            6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries. <br>
                            7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.

                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    The "Lord" (<i>Adoni</i>, used for man) at the right hand of Yahweh from verse 1 - which is frequently quoted as a reference to Jesus in the New Testament - is called the "Lord" (<i>Adonai</i>, used for God) at the right hand of Yahweh in verse 5.
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Verse 5 of Psalm 110 has a contested translation, with some translating it as something like, "O Lord, at your right hand is he who will shatter kings in the day of his wrath" (REV, NET, LEB). If the verse is rendered this way, then the one at the Lord's right hand would be the Messiah, as in verse 1.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    If the reading from the KJV above is favored, the verse could be referring to God being at the right hand of the Messiah using a different right hand idiom which is common in Scripture, wherein it represents one's power, strength, or agency (Psalm 16:8, 17:7, 18:35, 20:6, 21:8, 44:3, 48:10, 60:5, 63:8, 73:23, 77:10, 80:17, 89:13, 89:25, 89:42, 91:7, 98:1, 108:6, 109:31, 118:15-16, 138:7, 139:10). In this case, the "He" in verses 6 and 7 would be referring to the Messiah, after the address directed to the Messiah in verses 1-5.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Lastly, if this verse does in fact use "Adonai" to refer to the Messiah, it would be an instance of using that word in a way that does not signify absolute divinity, which would be contextually supported by the fact that He is said to be at the right hand of Yahweh, meaning He is definitely not Yahweh, but rather, is distinct from Yahweh.
