                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    The author of Hebrews quotes Psalm 102:25-27, which addresses Yahweh, and says that it applies to Jesus.
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    While some commentators believe that the subject switches in verse 10 to the Father, Unitarians who believe that God created by Jesus Christ would agree with Psalm 102:25-27 having an application to Jesus, as the creation of the world is the subject of the passage. Those who do not hold to pre-existence would see this as paralleling God's creation of the world with Jesus's creation of the world to come, based on Hebrews 2:5.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Additionally, as with the other texts that link Jesus to Yahweh, these are generally best viewed agentively (where one is acting as God's agent), where Jesus is the agent and closest expression of Yahweh, and so texts originally about Yahweh can be said to find fulfillment in Jesus. Note also that this passage is couched within an argument aiming to demonstrate that Jesus is ("by inheritance") superior to the angels (Hebrews 1:4-14), which would be superfluous if the writer thought that He was God, in which case he would only have to say as much and move on.
