                            37 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: <br>
                            38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? <br>
                            39 Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, <br>
                            40 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. <br>
                            41 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.

                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Argument: John quotes Isaiah 53:1 and Isaiah 6:10 about Jesus, and says, "These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him" (John 12:41). This refers to the glory of Yahweh spoken of in Isaiah 6:1-5, especially in the Septuagint, which additionally reads "glory" in Isaiah 6:1, and so John is identifying Jesus with Yahweh.
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    While it is possible that John is applying the passage about Yahweh to Jesus agentively (acting as God's agent), it is also possible that John is using "glory" in a more general sense, i.e., Isaiah, through his prophecies, saw the greatness of the Messiah, and truths about the Messiah, in a similar way Abraham can be said to have "rejoiced to see (Jesus's) day: and he saw it, and was glad" (John 8:56). 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Further, John quotes Isaiah 53, which is part of a passage which speaks of the Messiah in these terms - "he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high" (Isaiah 52:13), "he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand" (Isaiah 53:10), and, "Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong" (Isaiah 53:12).
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Therefore, the first passage that John quotes deals more directly with the exaltation of the Messiah, and on that basis is probably a better candidate for what John would be referring to in John 12:41, though John using "glory" in the general sense seems to be the most likely interpretation.
                </p>
