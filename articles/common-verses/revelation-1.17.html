                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Jesus is called the "Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last". These titles are used for God in Isaiah 41:4, 44:6, 48:12, Revelation 1:8, 1:11, 21:6. There can only be one "beginning and the end, the first and the last".
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Unitarians acknowledge that Jesus can share titles with God the Father, such as "Lord", "Savior", "King of Kings", and the ones used in the passages in question. While there can only be one "beginning and the end, the first and the last" in the absolute sense, Jesus can be said to be those things as it pertains to the new creation (which is the context of Revelation 22), primacy in creation in general (Revelation 3:14, <i>archeÌ„</i>, "beginning"), the resurrection from the dead (Revelation 1:5, Colossians 1:18: 1 Corinthians 15:20-23, etc.<!-- Acts 26:23 -->), or in some other sense that God sees fit as a reason to bestow the titles upon Him. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Additionally, as could be stated for each book containing the verses covered in this section, the testimony of the entire book of Revelation is that Jesus is distinct from God (Revelation 1:6, 3:2, 3:12, 3:14, 5:9-10, 7:10, 12:5, 14:12, 15:3, 21:22), and there is no confusion or ambiguity on that point when the book is considered as a whole.
                </p>
