                            56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad. <br>
                            57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? <br>
                            58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. <br>
                            59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.

                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Jesus says, "Before Abraham was, I am", which is Jesus identifying Himself with Yahweh, referencing Exodus 3:14. The Jews take up stones to stone Him, because they recognize that this is a divine claim. 
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    As covered in <a href="john-8.24.html">the discussion of John 8:24</a>, Jesus saying "I am He" here refers to Him being the Messiah, and is not a claim to be the "I Am" of Exodus 3:14. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Here, in referencing Abraham, Jesus is placing Himself, the Messiah, above Abraham, and saying that Himself being the Messiah was a prophetic reality before Abraham was a physical reality, and that was why Abraham was able to "see (His) day" (John 8:56). The Jews attempt to stone Jesus, because they do not like Jesus, and do not think He is the Messiah, and so this claim enrages them.
