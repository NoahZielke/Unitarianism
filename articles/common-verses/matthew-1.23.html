                            23 "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son. They shall call his name Immanuel;" which is, being interpreted, "God with us."

                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Jesus is called Emmanuel, that is, "God with us", because He is God. 
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    In the New Testament, Jesus is said to be the express image of God, and reveals God in such a way that He can say "he that has seen me has seen the Father" (John 14:9-11, compare John 1:18, 12:45: 2 Corinthians 4:4, Colossians 1:13-15, Hebrews 1:1-3), and it can be said of Him, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself" (2 Corinthians 5:19), and that "in him dwells all the fullness of deity bodily" (Colossians 2:9). 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Therefore, Jesus is called "God with us" because He is a manifestation of the power of God, and a token of God being with His people. Consider the following verse:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Ruth 1:6</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        6 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that <b>the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.</b>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    In the above passage, God being with the Israelites took the form of helping them meet their physical needs. It did not mean that God was actually walking around on earth. <!-- There are many such instances of this in the Old Testament (Genesis 21:1, Exodus 3:16, 4:31: 1 Samuel 2:21, Psalm 106:4, Jeremiah 15:15, 29:10, Zephaniah 2:7, Zechariah 10:3). -->The New Testament Emmanuel is a similar concept. Someone could call their child "Emmanuel" today, and it would be appropriate, as it would be calling the baby a blessing from God, or naming them in honor or recognition of God's other blessings. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    In fact, in the context of the original passage, the person in view is actually another "Emmanuel" who historically lived around the time of Isaiah:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Isaiah 7:14-16</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. <br>
                        15 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good. <br>
                        16 <b>For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.</b>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    Above, the child named "God with us" was alive during the time of Isaiah, and signified a different instance of God being with the nation of Israel. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Therefore, Jesus is "God with us", not because He is God, but because God visited His people by working through Jesus, who He gave His Spirit without measure (John 3:34).
                </p>
