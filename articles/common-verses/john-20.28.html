                            27 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. <br>

                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Thomas calls Jesus "my Lord and my God", and Jesus commends him for believing.
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    While Thomas's confession could be calling Jesus Himself God in the secondary or non-absolute sense as described in John 10:33-36, it is more likely referring to Thomas confessing that Jesus is the manifestation of the Father to them ("My Lord [Jesus], and my God [the manifestation of the God that I worship]"), as Jesus had told His disciples earlier in John's Gospel - and Thomas is specifically named in the scene - "he that has seen me has seen the Father":

                        6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. <br>
                        7 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. <br>

                        10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and <b>the Father in me</b>? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. <br>

                    The theme of seeing the Father in Jesus is spread throughout the Gospel of John, which says in chapter 1, "No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him" (John 1:18), and later has Jesus saying, "he that sees me sees Him that sent me" (John 12:45). Ultimately, this theme culminates in John chapter 20, in the passage in question. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Additionally, Jesus, in the same chapter as the passage in question, places God above Himself (John 20:17), and elsewhere states that the Father is "the only true God" (John 17:3). The Gospel of John, considered in its totality, is not confusing or ambiguous on this point.
