                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    "God" purchased the Church "with His own blood", which refers to the blood of Jesus. Therefore, Jesus is God.
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    This verse has both a textual variant, and a contested translation. In some manuscripts, it reads "church of the Lord" instead of "church of God". Additionally, many versions translate what is rendered "with His own blood" in the KJV as something like "with the blood of His own (Son)" (NRSVUE, CEB, CJB, CEV, LEB, NET, NCV, etc.). The reading in the KJV can still be understood in this way, as well, even if it remains as it is.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    And, if Jesus were in fact called "God" here, there are ways of understanding that from a Unitarian perspective. Here, Jesus would be called "God" in the lesser sense of the word, as it is used in Exodus 7:1, 21:6, 22:8-9, Psalm 82:1, 82:6, 97:7: 2 Corinthians 4:4, as explained by Jesus in John 10:33-36. But, a verse with a textual variant and translational controversy is not a solid basis from which to revise one's view of God as taught in the Bible, when there are so many clear verses to appeal to.
