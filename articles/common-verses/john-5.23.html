                            22 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: <br>

                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Jesus says that "all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father". All are supposed to honor the Father as God, therefore, this in this passage, Jesus is stating that He must be honored as God. 
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    It is incorrect to assert that "even as" (<i>kathōs</i>) in the verse in question means "to the exact same degree, and for the same reasons". That reading is a massive leap from what is actually stated, and would require a lot of accompanying evidence to justify it. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Instead, consider the meaning of "even as" (<i>kathōs</i>) in a verse like the following:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">1 Corinthians 11:1</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        1 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    Above, the Apostle Paul does not mean that the Corinthians must deem him to be as if he were the very Messiah. He does not mean "even as" in a qualitative way that would identify him with the Messiah, but in the sense that they are doing the action of following him, in whatever way that is appropriate, just as they follow Jesus Christ in whatever way is appropriate.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    The same principle explains Jesus's statement in John 5:23. He is stating that just as all perform the action of honoring the Father, they must perform the action of honoring Him, and it is the rest of Scripture that defines the context and degree to which that is appropriate. 
                </p>
