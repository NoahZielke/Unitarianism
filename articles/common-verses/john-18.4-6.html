                            4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? <br>
                            5 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. <br>
                            6 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.

                <h3>Argument</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Argument: Jesus says "I am", and the soldiers sent to arrest Him fall back, which identifies Him as Yahweh (Exodus 3:14).
                </p>
                <h3>Response</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    As explained in the <a href="john-8.24.html">discussion on John 8:24</a>, the term <i>egoÌ„ eimi</i> ("I am", "I am he", "I am the one") is a term of self-identification, and in John's Gospel, it is used of Jesus to say that He is the Messiah (John 4:25-26, 8:24, 8:28, 8:58, 13:19). The soldiers falling is significant, because they identify Him as "Jesus of Nazareth", and Jesus's "I am He" hearkens back to the aforementioned passages, in which He declares Himself to be no mere prophet or citizen of Nazareth, but the Messiah - the one who was prophesied to come, and who the people were expecting (John 1:19-21, 6:14, 7:40, Matthew 11:2-3, Luke 7:18-20). So, in John's Gospel, the phrase is often used to say, "I am that one, the one you are looking for, the Messiah who was prophesied to come".
