                    In a section on Biblical doctrine related to Jesus Christ's identity, <i>The ESV Study Bible</i> makes the following argument:

                        <b>Implications of the Two Natures of Christ</b> <br>
                        
                        The belief that Jesus is one person with both divine and human natures has great significance for the possibility of fallen people entering into a relationship with God. Christ must be both God and man if he is to mediate <i>between</i> God and man, make atonement for sin, and be a sympathetic high priest (Col. 1:19-20: 1 Tim. 2:5, Heb. 2:17). <br><br>
                        
                        <!-- For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross (Col. 1:19-20).

                        For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus (1 Tim. 2:5).

                        Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people (Heb. 2:17). -->
                        
                        In his seminal work <i>Why God Became Man</i>, Anselm of Canterbury (c. A.D. 1033-1109) summarized the importance of the two natures of Christ for his atoning work by saying, "It is necessary that the self-same Person who is to make this satisfaction [for humanity's sins] be perfect God and perfect man, since He <i>cannot</i> make it unless He be really God, and He <i>ought not</i> to make it unless He be really man" (Book II, ch. 7).

                    The above states that Jesus "must be both God and man if he is to mediate between God and man". This is a common argument in Trinitarian apologetics, so it is worth taking the time to engage with. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Firstly, it is significant that no author of Scripture makes this argument. The verses cited by the ESV Study Bible do not make this claim:
                </p>
                <ul class="gen">
                    <li>Colossians 1:19-20 - Speaks of the fullness of God's Spirit dwelling in Jesus, which strictly speaking, He would not need if He were Himself God, as He would already be God to the maximum extent by His very nature</li>
                    <li>1 Timothy 2:5 - Explicitly distinguishes Jesus from the "one God", and calls Jesus a "man"</li>
                    <li>Hebrews 2:17 - Refers to Jesus's humility as the Messiah, and establishes the significance of His atoning death, within the context of Hebrews chapter 2</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="gen">
                    Notice that each of the above passages explicitly distinguish Jesus from God. But, even if one were to grant that Jesus was God, it still would not follow that Jesus "must" have been God to reconcile mankind to God. That point is simply never made in Scripture.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    And, there are other places in Scripture that describe God's plan to reconcile mankind to Himself, wherein Jesus is clearly distinguished from God in ways that would be very confusing if the authors intended their readers to believe that if Jesus were not God, the atonement would have been invalid:

                        8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. <br>
                        9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. <br>
                        10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. <br>

                <p class="gen">
                    Notice how all three of the above passages speak of Jesus and God as separate subjects. The first century reader, unschooled in Trinitarian thought, would most naturally conclude that two different Beings are being spoken of in these places. And, if one of those Beings is God, and if there is "one God" (1 Timothy 2:5), then the other must not be God ("the man Christ Jesus"). 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    This understanding also makes the most sense of Jesus being called a "mediator" between God and mankind. If Jesus is one Person, as the Bible everywhere portrays Him, then if He is Himself God, then sinful mankind would ultimately have no mediator with God. Instead, God would be mediating with His very same Being on behalf of mankind, in which case it is hard to see what meaning could be given to "mediation", given that only two parties are involved. Instead, 1 Timothy 2:5 presents Jesus as a third party between God and those in need of redemption. 
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    The Bible never makes the argument that if Jesus were not God, the atonement would be invalid. This kind of argument is a later philosophical argument, and it stands upon a few layers of deduction and speculation. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Instead, the Bible, when speaking on the subject of the redemptive plan of God, clearly and without qualification distinguishes Jesus from God, and does so in ways that would naturally signal that they are distinct, and that Jesus is not God.
