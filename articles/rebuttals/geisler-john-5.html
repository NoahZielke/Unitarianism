                    In his <i>Systematic Theology in One Volume</i>, under the heading "Jesus Claimed to Be Equal With God", the Evangelical theologian Norman Geisler writes:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">Norman Geisler - Systematic Theology in One Volume, Chapter 12</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        Jesus also claimed that He should be honored as God: He said that all men should "honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him" (John 5:23). The Jews listening knew that no one should claim to be equal with God in this way, and again they wanted to kill Him (John 5:18).
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    Above, Geisler says that Jesus claimed that He should be "honored as God". He then interprets John 5:23 as Jesus saying that all need to honor the Son in the same way they honor the Father, meaning that they must honor the Son as God:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">John 5:23</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        23 That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    However, it is incorrect to assert that "even as" (<i>kathōs</i>) in the above verse means "to the exact same degree, and for the same reasons". That reading is a massive leap from what is actually stated, and would require a lot of accompanying evidence to justify it. 
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Instead, consider the meaning of "even as" (<i>kathōs</i>) in a verse like the following:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <h6 class="pt-2 quote-heading">1 Corinthians 11:1</h6>
                    <p class="mb-1 gen">
                        1 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="gen">
                    Above, the Apostle Paul does not mean that the Corinthians must deem him to be as if he were the very Messiah. He does not mean "even as" in a qualitative way, but in the sense that they are doing the action of following him, in whatever way that is appropriate, just as they follow Jesus Christ in whatever way is appropriate. The same principle explains Jesus's statement in John 5:23.
                </p>
                <p class="gen">
                    Returning to Geisler's quotation, he then insinuates that the Jews tried to kill Jesus after hearing what He said in John 5:23. But, to substantiate this claim, he references John 5:18, which took place before the passage in question, and was in response to Jesus's teaching that He had the right to determine what work was right for Himself to be doing on the Sabbath day (John 5:16-18). Therefore, what Jesus said in John 5:23 specifically cannot really be said to be the impetus for the hostile Jews' outrage.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="gen">
                    Jesus, in John 5:23, is not claiming that all must honor Him in the same manner and for the same reasons as God. Instead, He teaches that all who honor the Father must honor Him, and the rest of Scripture defines the context and degree to which that is appropriate. 
                </p>
